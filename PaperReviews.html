<b> PAPER REVIEW 1: LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY</b>
<br>

<a href = "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169204618300793?via%3Dihub">Spatial scaling of urban impervious surfaces across evolving
	landscapes: From cities to urban regions</a>
	<br>
	<br>
	This paper examines urban impervious surfaces (UIS) and their spatial allometry to understand how they change across 3 different geographical strata:
	the city proper, the metropolitan region, and the urban agglomeration as a whole in 3 Chinese urban regions

	Increasing urbanization and the consequent infrastructure boom has led to the conversion of natural and agricultural land uses into impervious land cover,
	such as rooftops, roads, sidewalks, parking lots, etc. These surfaces divert and prevent the natural absorption and flow of water, leading to challenges such
	as flooding, changes in land-surface energy balance (absorption and emission of longwave radiation), and can put cities at greater risk of developing urban heat
	islands. Increased urban runoff, flooding, decreased water quality and aquatic biodiversity and wetland ecosystems degradation can result due to high impervious
	 surface cover. While increased UIS is an indicator of greater urbanization, tracking their growth over time can also be used to measure of a city’s
	 environmental health.
<br>
<br>
The study was designed to address the following questions:
<br>
1. How do UIS area change with increasing spatial extent across urban administrative levels
<br>
2. How does the total amount and percentage of UIS scale differently in space?
<br>
3.Do the scaling relations of UIS found in the 3 Chinese metropolitan regions apply to other metropolitan regions in the world?
<br>
<br>
The results of this study show that scaling relations vary across the 3 urban hierarchies with UIS area increasing faster than urban area but more
slowly than urban population. The same trends were found at the city proper and metropolitan region scales for 6 different cities around the world.
Various ecological and geographical phenomena are influenced by the scale effect, a type of modifiable areal unit problem (MAUP). From these results,
the authors argue that this urban feature and its effects are best studied using a multiscale approach.
<br>
<br>
<b>Limitations</b>: The authors make no mention of edge effects which would come into play during their analysis of UIS in relation to scale. The satellite
 imagery used for UIS identification was also outdated (2009 data) for a study conducted in 2018 as China’s urban expansion patterns may be different
  now due to different policies and investments in infrastructure.

<b>PAPER REVIEW 2: HEALTH GEOGRAPHY</b>
<br><br>
<a href = "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10962247.2016.1143887"> Air quality mapping using GIS and economic evaluation of health impact for Mumbai City, India
</a>
<br>
<br>
The authors of this paper analyzed the seasonal and annual variations in air quality in Mumbai, Maharashtra, the most populated city in India and the fifth most populated in the world.
<br>
<br>
The study had two main goals:
<br>
1. Given that air quality by nature exhibits high temporal and spatial variation and the limited concentration of air quality measuring stations in the city, which
 spatial interpolation methods are most accurate for predicting air quality over the region?
 <br>
2. What are the economic costs of morbidity associated with air pollution?
<br>
<br>
Data on three particular pollutants, sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and suspended particulate matter (SPM - PM10) were interpolated in various regions
of the city and then compared to observed measurements. Finally, a health impact assessment was conducted within each ward (an administrative subsection of the city)
to estimate the economic cost of air pollution in the area. An estimated 509 billion rupees (9.77 billion CAD) was lost in 2012 due to NO2 and PM10 pollution in
Mumbai which is approximately 4.24% of the entire state of Maharashtra’s GDP.

	</div>
</div>

<b>Limitations:</b> There were only 7 stations collecting observed data in an area of 438km2 , and the choice of pollutants used were not justified or well thought out as PM2.5 would have been better pollutant to use in this study and SO2 data was not used in part two of study due to lack of literature on its negative health impacts. A major problem with this study is that no mention of the effects of confounding or extraneous variables such as ground pollutants, participant lifestyles, etc was made or acknowledged.
